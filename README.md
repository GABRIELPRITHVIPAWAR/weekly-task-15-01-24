Task: Setting up Jenkins for Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
Description: Configure Jenkins to automate the build, test, and deployment processes for your 
application.
1. Automated Testing in CI:
• Test Case 1: Integrate a sample application with automated unit tests into the CI 
pipeline.
• Expected Outcome: The CI pipeline should run the automated unit tests, and the 
pipeline should fail if any tests fail.
2. Scheduled Builds:
• Test Case 2: Schedule a periodic build (e.g., nightly build) and verify that the CI pipeline 
is automatically triggered at the specified time.
• Expected Outcome: The scheduled build should start automatically, and the CI 
pipeline should execute as configured.
3. Rollback Mechanism in CD:
• Test Case 3: Deploy a faulty version intentionally in the CD pipeline, trigger a rollback, 
and confirm that the application is reverted to the previous version.
• Expected Outcome: The CD pipeline should detect deployment failure, initiate a 
rollback, and the application should be reverted to the last stable version.  explain entire process with real time configurations to execute the above task .
